# Big Data Handling and Visualization with R

## Introduction
This section highlights a series of R and RStudio practices focused on various data science techniques ranging from probabilistic distributions to regression analysis and predictive modeling. Some of these practices were conducted collaboratively. For an extended view of my work, please visit my [R Pubs profile](https://rpubs.com/OscarIvan).

## Practices Overview

### 1. Poisson Distribution Analysis
Main Objective: Generate a Poisson distribution and determine probabilities based on its initial means.

### 2. Data Analysis and Correlation Coefficients
Main Objective: Conduct a data analysis identifying correlation coefficients between variables and a multiple linear regression model to make predictions with new data.

### 4. Normal Distribution Sample Simulation
Main Objective: Simulate a random sample according to the normal distribution with rnorm() function, having a mean of 175 and a standard deviation of 6, demonstrating data dispersion from the mean.

### 6. Discrete Variable Probability in Hypergeometric Distribution
Main Objective: Determine the probability of a discrete variable under hypergeometric distribution using dhyper() to find probabilities p(x=0,1…n) and phyper() for cumulative probabilities f(x=0,1…n).
