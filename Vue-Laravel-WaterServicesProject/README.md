# Water Services Management System

## Overview
This project was developed to introduce an efficient management system for potable water and sewage services in small towns, particularly in the state of Durango, Mexico. The version 1.0 of the system was successfully completed as part of an internship program, aiming to modernize and enhance the efficiency of local water services.

## Objectives
- To provide a modern and efficient management system for water services in areas lacking such infrastructure.
- To facilitate various user roles within the system, including cashier, administrator, and master roles, each with distinct responsibilities and capabilities.

## System Roles and Functionalities
- **Cashier**: Capable of handling payments, generating receipts, and capturing consumption readings.
- **Administrator**: Inherits all cashier functionalities, with additional capabilities such as linking contracts to discount campaigns and authorizing direct discounts on receipts.
- **Master**: Possesses comprehensive access to all system functionalities, including but not limited to managing services, rates, administrator and cashier users, contracts, categories, and geographical information like zones, neighborhoods, and streets.

## Development Process
This project was a collaborative effort from scratch, covering all phases from initial requirement gathering, design of interfaces, logo, and color schemes to the development of database and functionalities across both front-end and back-end.

## Note on Confidentiality
To respect the privacy and confidentiality agreements with the internship company, this repository will not include the project's codebase. Instead, it will showcase non-final versions of system outputs.
