# Unity and Blender Projects

## Introduction
This section of my larger Portfolio is dedicated to showcasing my work with 3D technologies, specifically Unity and Blender. Here, I present two game prototypes developed in Unity, complemented by 3D models and animations crafted in Blender, demonstrating my grasp of interactive design and 3D artistry.

## Projects Overview

### 1. WW2: France Scenario - Mobile Game Prototype
A mobile game prototype inspired by historical events, focusing on simple yet engaging gameplay mechanics. This project highlights my initial foray into game development with Unity, paired with custom 3D models and animations created in Blender.

### 2. Medieval Adventure Game Prototype
This prototype serves as a sandbox for experimenting with various gameplay mechanics common to open-world, medieval fantasy games like Skyrim. It features an inventory system, combat mechanics, and a designed medieval setting, among others mechanics. The project was developed to explore and understand the implementation of these mechanics within Unity, using custom 3D assets and animations I created in Blender to support the game's functionality and atmosphere.

## Blender 3D Models and Renders
In addition to game projects, this section includes a `Blender` folder containing various 3D models and renders. These pieces showcase a range of modeling, texturing, and rendering skills, illustrating my creative process and commitment to 3D design.

## Summary
The Unity and Blender projects within this portfolio encapsulate my journey and exposure into the realms of game development and 3D modeling. From conceptualizing game mechanics to crafting detailed 3D assets, each element reflects a step in my continuous learning and application of 3D technologies.
