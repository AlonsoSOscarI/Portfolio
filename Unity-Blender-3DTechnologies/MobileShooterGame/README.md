# WW2: France Scenario - Mobile Game Prototype

## Overview
"WW2: France Scenario" is a prototype for a mobile game inspired by historical events. Developed as a personal project using Unity and Blender, this prototype explores basic game mechanics, including movement, shooting, environmental interaction, and audio within a simple yet functional game environment. Unfortunately, due to issues with file corruption, I was unable to upload the entire folder for this project. However, I have retained the APK file, which allows me to share several key outputs that demonstrate the mechanics and models used in this prototype.


## Game Features
- **Basic Movement Controls**: Tailored for mobile platforms, the prototype offers straightforward controls for character navigation.
- **Shooting Mechanics**: Features a basic shooting mechanic, allowing players to fire a simulated weapon with visual and audio effects for muzzle flash and impact, aiming to provide a rudimentary sense of interaction with the environment.
- **Environment**: The prototype includes simple representations of historical elements like bunkers and trenches, intended to give a basic context to the gameplay setting.
- **Ammunition System**: Includes a simple ammunition and reloading system, challenging players to manage their resources during gameplay.
- **Models and Animations**: The game assets, including character, weapon, and environmental elements, were personally crafted for this prototype. While aiming for functionality, the graphics and animations serve the purpose of demonstrating basic gameplay elements.
- **Audio**: Incorporates basic sound effects, such as gunfire sounds, and ambient war music to enhance the immersive experience of the game setting.

## Development Process
"WW2: France Scenario" was developed as an exploratory project into game development, focusing on applying and practicing skills in Unity and Blender. The process involved:
- **Modeling and Animation**: Creating basic models and animations to fulfill the game's functional requirements.
- **Material and Texture**: Utilizing simple materials and sourced textures to achieve a coherent look within the prototype's scope.
- **Sound Design**: Integrating simple sound effects and background music to complement the gameplay and enhance the atmosphere.
