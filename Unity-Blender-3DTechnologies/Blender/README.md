# Blender 3D Projects

## Overview
This section of my portfolio is dedicated to showcasing my work with Blender 3, highlighting my skills in animation, rigging, modeling, shading, and a bit of sculpting. The [BlenderProjects](https://github.com/AlonsoSOscarI/Portfolio/blob/main/Unity-Blender-3DTechnologies/Blender/BlenderProjects.rar) folder contains a variety of projects I've undertaken, including assets used in the Unity projects mentioned elsewhere in this portfolio. For those interested in exploring all my Blender creations, including AddOns I've used and textures used in my projects, be sure to check out the [BlenderRef&AddOns](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12WJSGc1QVFivdmZj0pMgpiQFcqXUemmt/view?usp=sharing) folder.

## Featured Outputs

### 1. WW2: France Scenario Main Scene
The main scene from the "WW2: France Scenario" game featured in this portfolio. This output showcases the entire environment, including the beach, mountain, and bunkers. Note that water elements were added in Unity, hence their absence here.

### 4. Earth And Sun Shading Window
This project was inspired by my fascination with space. It showcases the shading setup for the Earth and Sun project, where rotating the Earth reveals city lights on the dark side and a daytime effect on the sunlit side.
