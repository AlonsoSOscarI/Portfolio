# Medieval Adventure Game Prototype

## Overview
This prototype is a fantasy-themed game inspired by the expansive worlds found in titles like Skyrim. Developed entirely in Unity and Blender, it showcases a range of functionalities set within a medieval environment. While the graphical fidelity and complexity are intentionally kept simple, all models, animations, and textures were created from scratch, emphasizing functionality over visual detail.

## Game Features
- **Inventory System**: A core feature allowing players to manage collected items, equipping or storing them as needed for progression.
- **Pick Up Mechanics**: Objects can be interacted with directly using 'F' to "hold" them or 'E' to add them to the inventory, facilitated by an invisible InteractionZone object that discerns interactable items.
- **Equipping Mechanism**: Players can equip and unequip items from their inventory, changing their capabilities and appearance.
- **Combat and Health**: The game includes a basic combat system where the player can attack with equipped weapons and defend using shields. A health system tracks the player's vitality during encounters.
- **Enemy AI**: Features a rudimentary AI enemy represented by a 3D rectangle that detects the player, initiates pursuit, and engages in combat.
- **Medieval Ambiance**: The environment includes medieval-themed elements like trees and an altar, enhancing the game's setting and atmosphere.
- **Equipment Modifiers**: Armor and weapons affect gameplay through modifiers that alter the player's damage output and resistance, adding depth to the combat and inventory systems.

## Development Process
The development journey for this prototype involved:
- **Modeling and Animation in Blender**: Every asset, including characters, equipment, and environmental elements, was personally crafted to support the game's mechanics and setting.
- **Unity Programming**: All game functionalities, from inventory management to enemy AI, were programmed in Unity, ensuring a cohesive gameplay experience.
