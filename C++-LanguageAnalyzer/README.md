# Uglya Language Analyzer

## Overview
The Uglya Language Analyzer is a comprehensive tool developed from scratch to analyze a custom programming language using a predictive matrix and state matrix approach. The development process involved meticulous planning, starting from constructing FIRST, FOLLOW, and PROD sets by hand, to implementing the logic in QT Community 5.0.2 using C++. This repository includes the QT project folder, Excel sheets for the matrices used, and the automaton diagram, providing a complete toolkit for language analysis: [Project Rar](https://github.com/AlonsoSOscarI/Portfolio/blob/main/C%2B%2B-LanguageAnalyzer/Uglya.rar)

## Features

### 1. The Automaton
This image showcases the automaton of the Uglya language, illustrating acceptance states within the range of 100 numbers, error states within the 500 range, and highlighting reserved keywords like `class`, `int`, `float`, `if`, `while`, etc.

### 3. Main Analyzer Frame
The primary interface of the analyzer features a user input field for entering the code to be analyzed, an "Open File" button for loading `.LYA` files, and an error table showing error codes and descriptions generated by the analysis. Additional sections include stacks for types, operators, and addresses, as well as the quadruple table indicating operations, operands, and results.

### 4. Predictive Matrix
The predictive matrix, originally detailed in Excel and later translated into a C++ matrix, shows the intersections of operations and reserved words. Entries marked with -1 indicate a syntax error, pointing out incompatible or unexpected language constructs.

### 5. State Matrix
This matrix defines the acceptance and error states critical to the analyzer's operation, outlining the logic for transitioning between different states based on input.

### 6. Code Example
A sample code snippet that demonstrates the analyzer in action. It defines a `test_` class using `class`, initializes integer variables `X` and `Y`, and employs a `while` loop to increment `X` if it's less than `Y`. The processes, including quadruples, jumps, and stack operations, are vividly displayed, showcasing the analyzer's depth.

## Conclusion
Uglya Language Analyzer represents a deep dive into the foundational aspects of compiler construction, offering a hands-on experience with lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis. Through this project, the complexities of language parsing and the power of predictive and state matrices in managing language rules are thoroughly explored.
